 <h2> <p style="text-align:left;">INTRODUCTION OF HTML</p></h2>
 <p style="text-align:left ;">HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the basic structure of a website by using a series of elements or tags that define different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. Each HTML element is enclosed within angle brackets, with an opening tag to start the element and a closing tag to end it. By combining various HTML elements, developers can create structured and visually appealing web pages that can be displayed in web browsers. HTML is essential for web development, serving as the foundation upon which websites are built.</p><br>

 <h2><b>HTML TAGS</b></h2><br>
 
 <ol>
    <h2><li><u>Heading tag</u></li></h2>
 
 <p style="text-align:left ;">HTML heading tags (h1 to h2) are used to define headings and subheadings within a web page. </p>
 <ul>
    <li><b>h1:</b> Represents the main heading of a page. It is typically the most important heading and should be used once per page.</li><br>
    <li><b>h2:</b>Represents a level 2 heading. It is used for subheadings that are important but slightly less significant than h1</li><br>
    <li><b>h3:</b>Represents a level 3 heading. It is used for further subheadings, and the importance decreases with each subsequent level.</li><br>
    <li><b>h4 to h6:</b>These represent decreasing levels of importance for headings. They are used for sub-subheadings and so on, with h6 being the least significant.</li>
 </ul><br>
 <h2><li><u>Paragraph tag</u></li></h2>
 <ul>
    <li><b>Purpose:</b> The tag is used to define a paragraph of text in an HTML document.</li> <br>
    <li><b>Usage:</b> It is one of the most commonly used tags in HTML for structuring and formatting text content.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Attributes:</b> The tag does not typically require attributes, but it can accept global attributes like class, id, style, etc., for styling and scripting purposes.</li> <br>
    <li><b>Styling:</b> Paragraphs are typically displayed with a space above and below them by default, and their appearance can be further controlled using CSS.</li>
 </ul><br>
<h2><u><li>Pre tag</li></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Purpose:</b> The pre tag (short for "preformatted") is used to preserve whitespace and line breaks within text, displaying it exactly as it appears in the HTML code.</li> <br>
    <li><b>Usage</b> It is primarily used for displaying text where whitespace, line breaks, and formatting are significant and should be maintained.</li><br>
    <li><b>Preservation of Whitespace:</b> Unlike normal HTML text, which collapses multiple spaces and line breaks into a single space or line break, text within pre tags preserves all formatting exactly as it appears in the HTML source code.</li><br>
    <li><b>Attributes:</b> The pre tag supports global attributes like class, id, style, etc., to apply styles or scripts to the content.</li>
</ul><br>
<h2><u><li>Br tag</li></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Purpose:</b> The br tag is used to insert a line break in text content within HTML documents.</li><br>
    <li><b>Single Purpose: </b>br is used specifically for line breaks within text, unlike p which defines paragraphs or div which defines divisions.</li><br>
    <li><b>Usage:</b> It is a self-closing tag, meaning it does not have a closing tag (br). It inserts a line break at the current position, without starting a new paragraph.</li>

</ul><br>
<h2><u><li>Hr tag</li></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Purpose: </b>The hrtag, short for "horizontal rule," is used to create a thematic break or divider between sections of content within an HTML document.</li><br>
    <li><b>Visual Representation:</b>It renders as a horizontal line across the width of its containing element, typically to visually separate content sections.</li><br>
    <li><B>Attributes:</B><br>width: Specifies the width of the horizontal <br>
        size: Sets the height of the rule as a pixel value.<br>
        color: Defines the color of the rule line.<br>
        noshade: Specifies that the rule should be rendered without a shadow effect (deprecated in HTML5).</li>
    
</ul>
</ol>
